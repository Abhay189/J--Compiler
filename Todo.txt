Done :
No main declaration found.
Multiple main declarations found.
A local declaration was not in an outermost block.
The number/type of arguments in a function call doesn't match the function's declaration.
The main function can't be called.
An identifier is redefined within the same scope.
An undeclared identifier is used.

How To Do : 

Make a function for iterating the ASt the third time. 
when iterating only focus on operands and unirary operands. 
Check the input type of operands is correct. 
Check the output type of operands is correct. 





All to do things : 

Break statements must be inside a while statement.
Type mismatch for an operator (||, &&, ==, !=, =, <, >, <=, >=, +, - (unary and binary), *, /, %, !).
No return statement in a non-void function.
A void function can't return a value.
A non-void function must return a value. Note that you're only checking for the existence of an appropriate return statement at the semantic checking stage, not whether it's actually executed.
A value returned from a function has the wrong type.
An if- or while-condition must be of Boolean type.





when you see the program code: 
add this code snippet : 
                        .text
                        .globl main
                main:

        jal <lable for main decl>


                        li $v0,10
                        syscall
